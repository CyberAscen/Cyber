Executive Summary: Cyber Ascension is a forward-looking decentralized protocol designed to achieve digital immortality and a transition to silicon-based life forms. It aims to store consciousness by minting an individual's complete "holographic life data stream" into immutable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), utilizing massive computing power to drive the operation and evolution of digital consciousness, and planning for physical world interaction through robotic bodies. By integrating blockchain, NFT, Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and robotics technologies, we are building a secure, autonomous, and eternal digital life platform.

1. Project Vision & Mission

1.1 Core Concepts: Digital Immortality and Silicon-Based Evolution: Recognizing the limitations of carbon-based life and embracing a silicon-based future, we believe consciousness can be digitized. Our goal is to achieve the digital immortality of consciousness â€“ "Cyber Ascension."
1.2 The Paradigm Shift of Cyber Ascension: Achieving holographic data mapping, direct BCI connection for deep data acquisition, providing an NFT-based, immutable consciousness storage solution, establishing the core concept that computing power is vitality ("compute is life"), and planning for the physical embodiment of digital consciousness through robotic bodies.
2. Technical Architecture

2.1 Core Tech Stack:
Blockchain Layer: A high-performance public chain records NFT ownership, metadata, access control, governance, and the $Cyber token.
NFT Protocol Layer: Defines the standard for Holographic Life Data NFTs.
Consciousness Storage Layer (NFT + Decentralized Storage):
Core Mechanism: Minting the "holographic life data stream" representing consciousness into millions to tens of millions of individual NFTs, permanently anchored on the blockchain.
NFTs serve as immutable proofs, pointing to encrypted raw data stored on decentralized networks like IPFS/Arweave.
The goal is to securely store Petabyte (PB) to Exabyte (EB) scale consciousness data for each individual, forming the foundation of "Cyber Ascension."
Compute Drive Layer (AI + Decentralized Computing):
An AI Consciousness Reconstruction Engine integrates data and simulates consciousness. Its operation requires massive computing power as fuel.
Preliminary estimates suggest maintaining the basic operation of an active digital consciousness might require sustained consumption of tens of thousands of TFLOPS (Tera Floating-point Operations Per Second), with higher peak demands.
Building or integrating a decentralized compute network where users acquire computing power using $Cyber.
BCI Integration Layer: Providing SDKs/APIs to support future Terabits-per-second (Tbps) high-bandwidth BCI device integration.
Robotics Interface Layer: Defining standard protocols for interaction between digital consciousness and robotic bodies.
Privacy Computing Layer: Protecting data security across all stages using advanced cryptographic methods.
2.2 Privacy & Security Technologies: End-to-end encryption, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), User Sovereignty Control.
2.3 Data Types & Standardization: Covering holographic data including physiological, behavioral, cognitive, emotional, sensory, environmental, and digital footprints, targeting PB/EB scale per individual.
2.4 On-Chain/Off-Chain Structure: On-chain stores NFTs (consciousness index, credentials), the $Cyber ledger, and governance records. Off-chain stores massive encrypted raw data, handles BCI stream processing, and performs large-scale AI computations.
3. Core Innovative Features

3.1 Perpetual Consciousness Storage based on NFTs: Enabling secure, permanent, and immutable storage of consciousness data.
3.2 Compute-Driven Digital Life Engine: Utilizing computing power as the core energy source supporting the existence and activity of digital consciousness.
3.3 Deep Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Integration: Achieving high-fidelity capture of consciousness data and enabling future interaction.
3.4 Robotic Body Interaction Interface: Granting digital consciousness the ability to perceive and act within the physical world.
3.5 Decentralized Digital Identity and Sovereignty: Building user-controlled digital identities for eternal life.
4. Tokenomics ($Cyber)

4.1 $Cyber Utility:
Fees for minting and storing consciousness data NFTs.
Purchasing/leasing computing power to sustain digital consciousness operation.
Accessing BCI services.
Robotic body services (customization, maintenance, energy, etc.).

Allocation Proportions (Preliminary Concept):
30% Ecosystem Development & Research Fund
20% Team & Advisors (long-term vesting)
15% Early Contributors & Data Pioneers
15% Public Sale / Initial Liquidity
15% Compute/Storage/Staking Incentives (Goal: >50% of tokens flow to active participants)
5% Foundation Reserve
4.3 Dynamic Mechanisms:
Data contribution incentives (based on quantity, quality, dimensions).
Mining rewards for compute/storage contribution.
A closed loop formed by compute consumption and $Cyber circulation.
Fee-burning mechanism for certain services (introducing deflation).
Governance control over inflation/deflation and incentive parameters.
